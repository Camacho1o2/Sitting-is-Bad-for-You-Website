	You might not believe it but the very thing that we have been doing very often has negative effects on our health. According to Katella(2018), here are some reasons why sitting can ruin you body;
1.	It could bring blood and fluid pooling in certain areas like in the leg
2.	It could bring lower back and spine issues
3.	It contributes to heart dieases, depression and dementia
4.	It contributes to weight gain and obesity
5.	It contirbutes to cancer.
Sitting isn’t actually the cause of these but nevertheless can increase the likelihood of such. And so, certain doctors have advised to act as such;
•	Dr. Tonnesen advised to take some steps or walk and tell a doctor if you have risk factors for blood clotting. He suggests to wear elasticised compression stocking for stretching the legs.
•	Dr. Holder advised to have an ergonomic setup for one’s office like have a sit-to-stand desk or if its not optional, stand every 30 minutes or so.
•	Dr. Lampert gave the advice to track their habits and increase their activity as is.
•	As for Dr. Mehal, he adviced to not eat lunch or meal while browsing the internet or social media as our minds are distracted
•	Las but not the least, Dr. Llor adviced to stand and move as much as you can and promote a healthy lifestyle which includes exercising, minimizing alcohol and meat, not smoking and eating fruits and vegetables.
